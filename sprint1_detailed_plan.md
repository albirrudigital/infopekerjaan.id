## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Testing
- Backend service methods
- Data transformation functions
- Core UI components

### Integration Testing
- API endpoints with database
- UI components with API services
- Data flow across services

### Manual Testing Focus Areas
- User experience flow validation
- Responsiveness across devices
- Edge cases for different user profiles

## 🚧 DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### External Dependencies
- Existing application data structure
- Authentication system integration

### Key Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data integration complexity | High | Medium | Start with minimal viable integration, progressive enhancement |
| Timeline visualization performance | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination and lazy loading from start |
| User experience consistency | Medium | Low | Leverage design system, regular UX reviews |
| API response time | High | Low | Implement caching strategy & monitoring |

## 🛑 BLOCKERS ANTICIPATION

| Potential Blocker | Early Warning Sign | Contingency Plan |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Data model complexity | Excessive joins or query time | Simplify model, denormalize where needed |
| Timeline rendering performance | Slow rendering with >20 items | Implement virtual scrolling or pagination |
| Integration with existing app data | Schema incompatibilities | Create adapter layer with transformation |
